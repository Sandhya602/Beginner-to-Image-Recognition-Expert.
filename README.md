# Vision AI in 5 Days: From Beginner to Image Recognition Expert

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the "Build an AI That Sees" bootcamp, guiding you through creating an **image recognition model** in Python using deep learning.

You will:
- Preprocess & augment images
- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Apply **transfer learning** with MobileNetV2
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Save models & visualizations for your portfolio
